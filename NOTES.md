**The blockchain**: Think of it as a cloud provider, kinda like AWS, but it's owned by no one. It's run by compute power from mining machines all over the world. Usually these people are called miners, and we pay them to run our code!

**A smart contract**: Kinda like our server's code with different functions people can hit.

This is pretty much the basis of most smart contracts. Read functions. Write functions. And changing a state variable. After this lesson we have the building blocks we need now to keep on working on our epic WavePortal.
